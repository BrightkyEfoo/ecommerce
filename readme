# Ecommerce Web Application
Hey you! My name is EFOO DJOUCK KOMEKA Brightman Klin, Please don't laugh at my english, because I'm natively a French speaker.
Thanks

HERE WE GOO!

## STACK
### FRONTEND
In my frontend I use **`ReactJS`**, precisely **`Next.js`** for templating, NextUI for components and some stuff like **`axios`** etc...
### BACKEND
In my Backend, I choose to use **`Express.js`**, because I'm very familiar with **`Express.js`**. I could use **`AdonisJS`**, 
but I still have less than 3 years of Experience with the framework

For database, I choose to use MongoDB, which is quite a byte easy to use. I think this app is only for test purpose; 
It doesn't really need any kind of relational logic now
