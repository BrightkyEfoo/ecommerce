# Ecommerce Web Application
Hey you! My name is EFOO DJOUCK KOMEKA Brightman Klin, Please don't laugh at my english, because I'm natively a French speaker.
Thanks

HERE WE GOO!

## STACK
### FRONTEND
In my frontend I use **`ReactJS`**, precisely **`Next.js`** for templating, **`NextUI`** for components and some stuff like **`axios`** etc...
### BACKEND
In my Backend, I choose to use **`Express.js`**, because I'm very familiar with **`Express.js`**. I could use **`AdonisJS`**, 
but I still have less than 3 years of Experience with the framework

For database, I choose to use **`MongoDB`**, which is somewhat quite simple to use. I think this app is only for test purpose; 
It doesn't really need any kind of relational logic now I think.
Anyway, I can reproduce all this app by using only a **`SQL`** database!
### DEVOPS
I use docker for containerization, Github Workflows for CI/CD and Vitest for further tests
